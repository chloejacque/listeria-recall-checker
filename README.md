## 💡 Inspiration
This project was inspired by the current Listeria outbreak in Ireland 2025.
After posting publicly about the outbreak and receiving a lot of concern from others, I wanted to create a useful tool to help others check if food was safe to consume.
This is my first Hackathon, and I am proud to have created something useful to others.
Thank you to the Boot.dev community for giving me this opportunity and motivating me to start my first project as a newbie in the software development community❤️
